<h2>Data Integration Using Microsoft Azure Data Factory</h2>

<p>The rapid growth of data volumes, formats, and sources has necessitated efficient data integration solutions. Microsoft Azure Data Factory (ADF) has emerged as a powerful cloud-based data integration service that enables organizations to collect, transform, and orchestrate data across various platforms and systems. This report provides a concise overview of the capabilities, benefits, and key considerations associated with using Microsoft Azure Data Factory for data integration.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<h5>1.Get 3 data source</h5>

<ul>
  <li>1. <a href="spotify.csv">spotify.csv</a></li>
  <li>2. <a href="spotify.json">spotify.json</a></li>
  <li>3. <a href="spotify.xlxs">spotify.xlxs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the data integration process using Microsoft Azure Data Factory, we work with three file formats: spotify.csv (CSV), spotify.json (JSON), and spotify.xlsx (Excel). These files contain Spotify-related data such as song details, playlists, user preferences, and engagement metrics. By leveraging Azure Data Factory, these files are seamlessly integrated, transformed, and processed for efficient data integration workflows.</p>

<h5>2.Setup Azure environment</h5>
