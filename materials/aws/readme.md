### Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing
AWS Academy Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a follow-up course to AWS Academy Machine Learning Foundations. The course is at an intermediate technical level (similar to the AWS Academy Architecting, Operations, and Developing courses) and is appropriate for students who are pursuing careers that require machine learning (ML) knowledge.

### Data Engineering
AWS Academy Data Engineering is designed to help students learn about and get hands-on practice with the tasks, tools, and strategies that are used to collect, store, prepare, analyze, and visualize data for use in analytics and machine learning (ML) applications. Throughout the course, students will explore use cases from real-world applications, which will enable them to make informed decisions while building data pipelines for their particular applications.

### Lab Project - Cloud Data Pipeline Builder
AWS Academy Lab Project - Cloud Data Pipeline Builder provides students with a project-based learning experience that reinforces technical skills taught in AWS Academy courses. AWS Academy Lab Projects offer students an opportunity to demonstrate critical thinking, problem-solving, an understanding of software development lifecycle, and communication skills. Each AWS Academy Lab Projects include a real-life scenario, an instructor guide, a student guide, a rubric, and a template with guidance for students to create a presentation of their project solution.
