# Structured Data

Structured data refers to data that is organized and follows a predefined format or schema. It is typically stored in relational databases, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. Key details about structured data:

- **Characteristics**: Structured data has a well-defined structure, fixed data types, and clear relationships between data elements. It is highly organized, making it easy to search, retrieve, and manipulate.

- **Storage**: Structured data is stored in relational databases that enforce a fixed schema. The schema defines the structure of the data, including tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.

- **Querying**: Structured data can be queried using Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL allows for precise retrieval and manipulation of data based on specific criteria, such as filtering, sorting, joining, and aggregating.

- **Examples**: Common examples of structured data include financial records, customer information, inventory management data, transactional data, and employee records.

- **Database Example**: An example of a database management system (DBMS) that handles structured data is MySQL. MySQL is an open-source relational database that provides robust features for managing structured data efficiently. It supports SQL queries, transactions, indexing, and data integrity constraints.

Structured data and the relational databases that manage it are widely used in various industries and applications due to their ability to ensure data consistency, integrity, and reliability.
