## Introduction: 

In today's digital age, book rating system can play a role in shaping readers' choices, influencing book sales, and contributing to the overall book ecosystem. Our group is excited to embark on a collaborative assignment to develop a book rating system using MongoDB as the database and PHP as the backend scripting language. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Visual Studio Code, we aim to create a robust and user-friendly platform that streamlines the book rating with readers satisfaction.

The primary objective of our assignment is to provide a standardized and accessible way for readers to evaluate and compare books. By integrating MongoDB as the database and PHP for backend development, we will leverage the flexibility, scalability, and real-time data handling capabilities of these technologies. Our goal is to create a reliable and efficient platform that collect books rating with different reader's perspective and empowers authors to provide better ideas and improve their writing skills.

## System Design: 
Describe the system architecture, data requirements, and functionalities.

### Data Requirements

The data requirements include storing and managing books data. Some of the essential data fields are as follows:
